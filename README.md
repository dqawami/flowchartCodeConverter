# flowchartCodeConverter
An open source Java application that will allow users to turn a software flowchart into code and vice versa. This has multiple applications, such as:
* Halving development time for updating software flowcharts and the code itself
* A learning tool to better understand how software works

## Features
As this project has just started development, no features have been added. Make sure to check back later for more additions. 

## Development
The project has yet to be finished, but all completed files will be on the master branch. As a student with an erractic schedule, updates will not be given at a constant rate. I will make sure to communicate when development will be slowed.

## To-Do List
These are the items that are being worked on:

### "Hello, World!"
This will be the test to make sure the converter works, by being able to create "Hello, World!" as a software flowchart, and having it be turned into Java code. Progress on this can be found in the helloWorld branch. 
NOTE: Many features (saving, compiling, running, etc.) will be added to the system after the flowchart-to-code component is tested.
